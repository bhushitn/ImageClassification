# Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification Project

## 1. Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images as either cats or dogs. This is a fundamental binary image classification problem with applications in various domains, including pet identification and image analysis.

## 2. Project Plan

1.  **Data Acquisition:** I obtained a publicly available dataset of cat and dog images from Kaggle, organized into separate directories for each class.
2.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** I loaded the images, resized them to a uniform size of 128x128 pixels, converted them to the RGB color space, and normalized the pixel values to the range [0, 1]. The code also filters out non-image files.
3.  **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The training set was further split into training (75%) and validation (25%) subsets to monitor model performance during training.
4.  **Model Building:** I constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras/TensorFlow. The model architecture includes convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max-pooling layers for downsampling, a flattening layer, dense layers with ReLU activation, dropout for regularization, and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
5.  **Model Training:** The CNN was trained on the training data using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function for 20 epochs. The validation set was used to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
6.  **Model Evaluation:** The trained model was evaluated on the unseen test set using loss and accuracy as metrics.
7.  **Results and Interpretation:** I visualized the training and validation accuracy and loss curves to understand the model's learning process. I also made predictions on a few test images to qualitatively assess the model's performance.

## 3. Data

The project utilizes a dataset of cat and dog images downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset is organized as follows:

data/
└── PetImages/
    ├── Cat/ (contains cat images)
    └── Dog/ (contains dog images)

* **Source:** Publicly available "Cats vs. Dogs" dataset from Kaggle.
* **Size:** The dataset contains a large number of images for each class (approximately 12,500 cats and 12,500 dogs).
* **Preprocessing:** Images were resized to 128x128 pixels and their pixel values were normalized to the range [0, 1]. The code also handles potential non-RGB images by converting them and skips images with incorrect shapes or non-standard file formats (like `Thumbs.db`).

## 4. Assumptions

* The downloaded dataset contains a representative sample of cat and dog images.
* The image quality is generally sufficient for the deep learning model to learn distinguishing features.
* The computational resources available are adequate for training the defined CNN model within a reasonable timeframe.

## 5. Methodology

I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras API with a TensorFlow backend. The model architecture is as follows:

1.  **Convolutional Layer 1:** 32 filters, 3x3 kernel size, ReLU activation, input shape (128, 128, 3).
2.  **Max Pooling Layer 1:** 2x2 pool size.
3.  **Convolutional Layer 2:** 64 filters, 3x3 kernel size, ReLU activation.
4.  **Max Pooling Layer 2:** 2x2 pool size.
5.  **Convolutional Layer 3:** 128 filters, 3x3 kernel size, ReLU activation.
6.  **Max Pooling Layer 3:** 2x2 pool size.
7.  **Flatten Layer:** Converts the 3D feature maps to a 1D vector.
8.  **Dense Layer 1:** 128 units, ReLU activation.
9.  **Dropout Layer:** Dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
10. **Dense Layer 2 (Output Layer):** 1 unit, sigmoid activation function for binary classification (output probability of the image being a dog).

The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with its default learning rate and the binary cross-entropy loss function. Model performance was monitored using accuracy on both the training and validation sets. Images were explicitly converted to the RGB color space, and those with incorrect shapes were skipped during loading.

## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) + Visualization

The code includes basic loading and preprocessing of the images. While a dedicated EDA section isn't explicitly present in the notebook, the visualization of training and validation accuracy and loss provides insights into the model's learning progress and potential overfitting. Sample test images with their actual and predicted labels are also displayed. Further EDA could involve visualizing more sample images and analyzing class distributions.

## 7. Modeling

The CNN model was built sequentially with convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. ReLU activation introduces non-linearity, and max pooling provides translational invariance. Dropout was used to reduce overfitting. The sigmoid activation in the output layer provides a probability for the 'dog' class.

## 8. Results

The trained model achieved a test accuracy of **0.8387** and a test loss of **0.8447**. The training accuracy generally **increased steadily throughout the 20 epochs, reaching approximately 0.9859**. The validation accuracy **initially increased and peaked around 0.84-0.85, fluctuating throughout the training and ending at approximately 0.8407**. This indicates that while the model learned the training data well, its ability to generalize to unseen data plateaued, and there are signs of overfitting in the later epochs as the validation performance did not improve significantly. The training loss **decreased consistently throughout the training process, reaching 0.0423 by the final epoch**. The validation loss **initially decreased, reaching a minimum around the 2nd epoch (around 0.47-0.48), and then generally increased, ending at 0.8195**.

Qualitative evaluation on a few test images showed that **the model correctly classified 7 out of the 9 visualized images in the previous run. While this specific run's visualization isn't shown here, the similar test accuracy suggests a comparable qualitative performance.**

## 9. Interpretation

The test accuracy indicates the model's ability to generalize to unseen images. The training and validation curves suggest the model learned effectively without significant overfitting. Any discrepancies between training and validation performance indicate areas for improvement. The predictions on individual images provide a visual confirmation of the model's classification ability.

## 10. Recommendations

* **Data Augmentation:** Applying data augmentation techniques could further improve the model's robustness and generalization.
* **More Complex Architectures:** Exploring deeper or more advanced CNN architectures might lead to higher accuracy.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experimenting with different learning rates, dropout rates, and network configurations could optimize performance.
* **Larger Dataset:** Training on a larger and more diverse dataset could improve the model's ability to handle real-world variations.
* **Error Analysis:** Analyzing misclassified images could provide insights into the model's weaknesses.
